### Hi,  I'm Owen Evans 👋

I'm a materials chemist by training,  but love solving problems through advanced data analytics.  I recently completed (Dec 2021) my master's degree studies for Data Science at Merrimack College and am looking forward to leveraging this newfound knowledge to further my career goals.    I've initialized this GitHub account to memoralize the multitude of projects I have worked on during my studies and as a platform for future personal DS projects.   Going forward,  I hope to continue to learn the fundamentals of Data Science and will document my effots on future projects using this account.
